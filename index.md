# Nathan McKinley's First CS 193 Homework

My Favorite Things About CS193 So Far
- **Only having class once a week**
- Relaxed TAs teaching the class
- Not too much homework, spread out pretty nicely
- Teaching actually helpful tools and things to know about CS
  - _As somebody who loves coding but is still very inexperienced in a lot of aspects of CS_
